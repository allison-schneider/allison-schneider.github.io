                <p>
                  The closest paid lot is at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/kbXbM72LSiwnsVKn9">139 Mass Ave</a>. It used to be free on weekends, but now it appears you need to pay using an app/website called <a href="https://www.paybyphone.com/">PayByPhone</a>. All-day parking is $29. The lot is small, but we have usually had success parking there.
                </p>

                  Other parking garages nearby are listed on <a href="http://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/parking/visitors/public_parking.html">MIT's website</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you want to gamble on getting free parking, your best bet is Memorial Drive (which runs along the Charles River on the Cambridge side). It is unlikely there will be spots there on a Saturday, but if you are staying for a couple days you can find a spot at night and leave your car there for the duration of your stay. (I have left my car there for a week before).
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can also park your car by a T stop and ride in- the venue is a 10 minute walk from Kendall Square (on the Red Line). The 1 Bus also drops off right next to the venue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are dropping someone else off, the best place to do so is at <a href="https://maps.google.com?q=42.3595230,-71.0944897&hl=en-US&gl=us">this drop-off area</a> along Mass Ave.
